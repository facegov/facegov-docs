# Lambdas Naming Conventions

When naming AWS Lambda functions, AWS recommends to follow these naming conventions:

1. Use a descriptive and meaningful name that reflects the function's purpose.
2. Use a combination of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (-).
3. The name should start with a letter.
4. The name should not contain spaces or other special characters.
5. The name should be unique within your AWS account and region.
6. The name should be concise and easy to read.
7. Consider using a naming convention that includes the project or service name, environment (e.g., dev, prod), and a brief description of the function's purpose.

FaceGov leverages conventions 1 to 6.  An example of FaceGov' function name is:&#x20;

`user-registration`

It's important to follow these naming conventions to ensure consistency and maintainability across your AWS resources.
