* ReactJS: ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It introduces the concept of JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript.
* JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, proposed by React. It's not a separate language, but a way to structure component rendering in React.

* TSX (TypeScript JSX): TSX is the TypeScript equivalent of JSX. It allows you to use JSX syntax within TypeScript files
